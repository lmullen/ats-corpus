## America Tract Society corpus

This corpus contains plain text versions of publications by the American Tract Society between 1800 and 1900 (according to the Internet Archive's metadata, anyway). This corpus was created for the purpose of testing document similarity and text reuse algorithms. The ATS frequently republished tracts under the same title. Furthermore, they published volumes with collections of tracts. So there are many examples of text reuse to be detected. (And of course, the documents are historically interesting in their own right.)

The texts themselves are in the `corpus` directory. The file `manifest.csv` contains the file names in the corpus along with associated metadata.
